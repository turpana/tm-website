## What is it?
An artist-owned digital coop providing concert ticket sale services with a focus on supporting small and indendent artists and venues.
## Why?
Concert service fees are too high and artists don't have much say in the matter.
## Where?
Independent music venues.
## How?
1. Find like minded people interested in collaborating on this project.
2. Work through questions regarding the coop's founding structure and product launch features:
 - What is the viability of the project?
 - What features must be included for minimum viable product?
 - Where does it fit in the current ecosystem of digital tools and platforms used by artists and venues?
 - What will be the cooperative's governing structure?
 - Who will be eligible to join and what will be the membership tiers?
 - How will seed funding be gathered? Kickstarter? Member contributions? Grants?
 - What will be the pricing model?
 - How will the platform be sustained?
3. Build the thing.
4. Get the word out.
5. Maintain and grow.
